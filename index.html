       <h2> About me</h2>
       <p> I live in columbus ohio and have lived here since i was age 2.
      
   I am very excited to delve deeper into web design and collaborate with other designers because i feel this will 
    allow me a  different avenue to express my creative side</p>
       
  <p> outside of web development i love going on youtube and finding fun DIY's to try</p>
